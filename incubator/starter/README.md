# Starter Stack

A minimal, runnable starter stack that can be used as a base for developing new stacks. This stack provides a sample application template consisting of single line bash scripts, along with all the settings in Dockerfiles and manifests to allow you to use the Appsody CLI to test out init/run/debug/test/build/deploy ahead of starting to make changes to a copy of this stack for yourself.

For any new stack, this Readme should explain in detail about this stack and any templates included, e.g.:

- How can a user start using this stack for application development
- links to getting started guides etc.
