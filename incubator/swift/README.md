# Swift Stack

The Swift stack is designed to provide a foundation for building and running Swift applications in Appsody.

This stack is based on the `Swift 5.0` runtime and allows you to develop new or existing Swift applications using Appsody.

## Templates

Templates are used to create your local project and start your development. When initializing your project you will be provided with the default template project. This template provides a simple application that prints "Hello World".

## Getting Started

1. Create a new folder in your local directory and initialize it using the Appsody CLI, e.g.:

    ```bash
    mkdir my-project
    cd my-project
    appsody init swift
    ```
    This will initialize a Swift project using the default template.

1. After your project has been initialized you can then run your application using the following command:

    ```bash
    appsody run
    ```

    This launches a Docker container that continuously re-builds and re-runs your project, exposing it on port `8080`.

    You can continue to edit the application in your preferred IDE (VSCode or other) and your changes will be reflected in the running container within a few seconds.
